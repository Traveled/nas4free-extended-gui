0.5.0.1 2015.10.08  F: (some) disk SMART values were not shown correctly in rare/special cases

0.5     2015.10.04  This is a new release which includes full N4F 10.x support (removed all dependencies of system files so it should be save for future os versions) and a complete redesigned logic which reduces disk accesses to an absolute minimum, especially to avoid unneccesary disk access at every refresh.
                    N: STATUS | SYSTEM - support for all RAID variants
                    N: combined Install / Update option

                    C: clogdir for CONFIG, notifications.log etc

                    F: Purge - change file find from mtime (modification time) to atime (access time)
NOTE: the display of Operating System (root filesystem as A_OS) and /var filesystem (as A_VAR) is not yet implemented, will come with the next release!
